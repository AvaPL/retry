## initial release

Extracted from [Dispatch Reboot](http://dispatch.databinder.net/Dispatch.html) this library provides generalized abstractions
for retrying failed scala.concurrent.Futures.

Current support is provided for retrying a given number of times ( retry.Directly ), retrying with a pause ( retry.Pause ), and retrying with an exponential
backoff ( retry.Backoff ).

To get started see the projects [readme](https://github.com/softprops/retry#readme)
